 * Wrap the `pg` `clientBuilder` function to add co extensions.

 * Since the exposed `clientBuilder` function from `pg.native` is a simple function that wraps the
 * construction of a native client connection, we don't have easy access to the prototype to inherit
 * prior to construction of the connection. Instead, we call the `pg` `connectionBuilder` to get an instance
 * of the connection and add additional methods directly to the constructed object. The methods are *not*
 * added to the `pg` `Connection` prototype however, as that would alter the prototype in `pg`, and would
 * increase the `co-pg` footprint beyond constructed objects that have been tunneled through this package.
 *
 * @param {function} clientBuilder the native client builder from `pg`
 * @returns {function} the native client builder with co extensions
